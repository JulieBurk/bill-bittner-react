                <p>Hello, my name is Bill Bittner. I enjoy lots of activities, but mostly playing music, woodworking, being in nature, and, of course, programming. I am fascinated by the web and how it continues to grow, and I am energized by getting to be a part of that growth.</p>
                <p>I grew up in Sacramento, California, but I moved to Los Angeles to go to USC and I have lived here ever since. Now Los Angeles is one of my favorite cities in the world. </p>
